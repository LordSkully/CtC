# Conquer the Constant Changelog
## Worldgen
### New Content For Old Biomes
- Wild Tubers can be uncommonly spotted in The Constant's grasslands and clearings. When dug up, they reward you with 17.5 Hunger & work as a potato in the crock pot.
- Webbed Trees are uncommonly spotted in The Constant's forests. They are home to a new kind of arboreal spider that shoots wooden pulp at you.
- Asparagus can really be found in clearing, but more commonly found near large areas of ponds. 
- Brine Pools spawn in the mosiac and can be found in the Rockylands. They spawn skittish Salt Crabs that can be killed for fish meat, rocks, or salt.
### Setpiece Changes
- The Gigantic Bee Hive can spawn in any "bee" biome. It is surrounded by 4 hornet nests
- The Glommer Statue no longer gives a free pan flute
- There is a chance to generate a world with 6, or 10 wormholes
- Only one touch stone spawns, be careful!
### New Biomes
- Five new optional tasks are able to be spawned
	- A field bountiful with a load of tubers. Salt Ponds spawn within the biome's crags
	- A mini-desert. Housing *parsnips*, Volt Goats, and hounds
	- A deiciduous bog full of spiders and traps. Something terribly wrong has happened to those who inhabited this place.
	- A marsh with a congregation of Merms. They enjoy eating the mysterious vegetation the grows in the grasslands within.
	- A sinister forest, infested with Hornets & Spiders but rich in berries. 	
### Corrupted Biomes
- Every time you generate a world, 2 out of the 8 biomes in your world will switch to a random *corrupted* version of said biome
- There are too many to summarize in this changelog but just know that they are versions of the biome that are altered to be more difficult and uncompromising. Gives the game much more replayability. More info on the wiki?
## Mobs
